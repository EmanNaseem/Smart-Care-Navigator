 Smart-Care-Navigator
 Smart Care Navigator is a Python (Tkinter) desktop application that combines emergency hospital routing with priority-based appointment scheduling.
 It uses Dijkstra’s algorithm to find the nearest hospital and visualize the shortest route, while priority queues (heaps) ensure emergency patients are served first.
 The project demonstrates practical use of graphs, data structures, and GUI development in a healthcare scenario.
